  In sentence construction, parallelism refers to using consistent structure between two clauses or phrases (i.e., saying I prefer trains over buses instead of I prefer trains over a bus). That same principle applies to paragraphs within a greater text: Each paragraph should have a similar structure for the sake of consistency. 

Parallelism is crucial when writing about comparisons or using a point-counterpart format. If you’re comparing two or more arguments, it’s best to maintain the same structure for both arguments (and the paragraphs that explain them). Typically, the two most common formats are known as block and point-by-point. 

Let’s say you’re writing an essay comparing apples and oranges. Block structure would use an individual paragraph discussing everything about apples—taste, appearance, etc.—and then follow it with another individual paragraph discussing those same attributes for oranges. 

Point-by-point structure, however, would mix it up a little. The first paragraph might center around taste and include data about both apples and oranges. Then the second paragraph would move on to a new point, like appearance, and would likewise include information on both apples and oranges. 

Neither format is inherently better than the other—the best choice depends on the topic and context. The important thing is that you stick with your choice throughout the entire piece; switching randomly between formats is considered poor writing.
